## Project Description
This was a part of the Odin Project Curriculum in the React Section. Small memory game application where player has to click on each character once without repeating. The cards will shuffle everytime a card is clicked on. The game tracks player's current score and best score. Main focus was to integrate useEffect in the project.

## Reflection
This porject was when I felt fully comfortable with TypeScript and React. The project did not take me as long as I thought it would potentially because of the amount of practice I did on the React website. useEffect was not hard to understand as well. I want to eventually use it for an api in the future.
